# Flappy Bird (Python, BasicIO)

This is a recreation of the famous Flappy Bird game using the `basic_io` graphics library provided by my university. The library supports basic graphics functions (drawing polygons, rectangles, images, etc.) and keyboard input handling.

## How to Play

- Start the game by pressing `r`.
- Control the bird by pressing `u` to jump.
- If you achieve a new high score, it will be saved for the current session.
