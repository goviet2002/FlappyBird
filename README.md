### This is a recreation of the famous Flappy Bird game using just basicio provided my university. This basicio can do some graphic basic functions like draw polygon, rectangle, etc.. or adjust keys from keyboard to do some specified tasks.

It is really simple to start the game by clicking r and then u to controll the bird. If you gain the best score so far, it will be saved in the scoreboard in the current session.
